- helm configuration

- helm first/second problem

  - grep is always moving
    - ack & ag
      - specify files
        - search in grep results?
        - file ambiguity (saving should work)
          - projectile configuration
            - remove .gitignore & saas files (serch for "mo" or "mongo") (can't do with ack?)
